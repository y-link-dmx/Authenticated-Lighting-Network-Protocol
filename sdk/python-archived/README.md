# Archived Python SDK Runtime

`alpine-sdk` previously provided a Python runtime wrapping discovery, handshake, and streaming. This directory is archived:

- It no longer receives maintenance or release updates.
- It does not perform control-plane MAC verification or session handling.
- For now, Python consumers should use the protocol bindings (`protocol/python`) and defer full SDK usage until a future release.

Keep this directory for reference only; it does not represent a supported SDK runtime in this phase.
